# Vertice Shader
Is this small project I wanted to figure out how to deform a mesh using shaders
I have looked for difrent ways this can be acoplished but i took the quikest and easyest way

The model I used for this example project is Unity-chan (from the unity asset store)
I do not own any of the textures, models or animations from that model, and is purely
for example purposes only.

## Software Analysis 
I picked out a few options to make this project in:

Unity:
	Unity is the engine I have most expiriance with and I know my ways around it quite well.
	It is also a very friendly engine and has a lot of the tools ready for use and it is documented well.
	Unity has some good shader support and allow the user to quickly make one, and assign it to a material.
	Unity has a nicer overlay, and a quicker feel to it. Except when entering play mode to test your projects.
	Unity quickly deteriates in performance once your projects start to increase in size, and it makes unity feel like a still in progress engine rather than a more stable and finished engine.

Unreal:
	Unreal engine is not my strongest engine, I have trouble finding my way in it but its an engine that i do want to go deeper in.
	Not very friendly to new users, it has a complex interface in my opinion and tools and other stuff is difficult to find.
	Unreal engine has a bit of a messier interface, but overal performance is quite better than Unity. instead of having to wait around 10 seconds to enter play mode, it is nearly instant, no matter the size. Unreal handles pre rendering and memory good, and has a good performance.

Java:
	Java is one of my least favourite languages to use due to haveing to write everything from scratch but it does feel more rewarding when you make something work.
	But I have seen some amazing stuff being made with it (example: Minecraft).
	And from things I have read there's a lot of libraries allowing me to make meshes and deform them on the fly with code.
	I couldn't find much about java compared to Unity and Unreal since the java community is not busy with being the best of the engines, unlike unity and unreal.
	Java has some good perks over unreal and unity, you are much more free to do what you want since you are not limited to the engines borders. but it does make it more sensitive to fatal errors. 

Conclusion:
	I chose Unity in the end, I know my ways around it the best of the softwares/engines I looked at.
	And in the small timescale we have for these assignments here at college I rather use something I know than spend days trying to
	find my ways in unknown enviorements.


## Goals of this project 
- The goal of this project was to learn more abotu vertices, shaders and mesh rendering.
